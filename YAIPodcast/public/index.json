Yet Another Investigative Podcast is a data-driven, nonfiction investigative and storytelling podcast hosted by two passionate data professionals, Olivia and Brett. YAIP explores unsolved events, confounding occurrences, and true crime stories through a research-driven lens.\nIn a landscape filled with speculation and sensationalism, we felt a pressing need for deeper, more analytical discussions around these captivating, astonishing topics. YAIP strives to bring clarity and logic to the narrative. With a commitment to factual accuracy and thoughtful research and analysis, we aim to provide insights that are often overlooked in traditional storytelling. And, we make our analysis code open source after every applicable episode on Github.\nWe hope our work can promote a safer world by equipping listeners with the ability and interest to both critically examine the world around them and practice compassion towards others in situations foreign to their own perspectives.

This prefix is used playfully in titles of projects, papers, events, etc. to promote curiosity and interest in a body of work whose topic appears unoriginal, though the content is unique and novel.1 Computer scientist Stephen C. Johnson is credited with creating this naming convention when in the late 1970s he named is compiler-compiler YACC (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler)2 because he felt there were already a plethora of compiler generation tools around at the time.\nDisclaimer The YAIP team performs their own research and analysis for each episode.
