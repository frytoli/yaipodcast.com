## What is *Yet Another Investigative Podcast*?

Yet Another Investigative Podcast is a data-driven, nonfiction investigative and storytelling podcast hosted by two
passionate data professionals, Olivia and Brett. YAIP explores unsolved events, confounding occurrences, and true crime
stories through a research-driven lens.

In a landscape filled with speculation and sensationalism, we felt a pressing need for deeper, more analytical
discussions around these captivating, astonishing topics. YAIP strives to bring clarity and logic to the narrative. With
a commitment to factual accuracy and thoughtful research and analysis, we aim to provide insights that are often 
overlooked in traditional storytelling. And, we make our analysis code open source after every applicable episode on
[Github](https://github.com/yaipodcast).

We hope our work can promote a safer world by equipping listeners with the ability and interest to both critically
examine the world around them and practice compassion towards others in situations foreign to their own perspectives.
Thank you for listening!

## What is the significance of "Yet Another..."?

"Yet another..." is a naming convention historically associated with computer and technology humor. This prefix is used
playfully in titles of projects, papers, events, etc. to promote curiosity and interest in a body of work whose topic
appears unoriginal, though the content is unique and novel.[^fn1] Computer scientist Stephen C. Johnson is credited with
creating this naming convention when in the late 1970s he named is compiler-compiler YACC (Yet Another
Compiler-Compiler)[^fn2] because he felt there were already a plethora of compiler generation tools around at the time.
